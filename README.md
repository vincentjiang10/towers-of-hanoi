## Towers of Hanoi

### Project Description
This project was inspired by and based on the Towers of Hanoi puzzle and its variants. The recursive nature of towers puzzle motivated me to create this web application to animate and visualize different puzzle solutions and configurations. You can visit the site [here](https://towers-of-hanoi-4d72b.web.app/). Google Chrome is recommended.

### Features
The application contains many features, including changing the puzzle type and rules, setting the number of towers and disks, and changing the source tower (the starting tower for disks) and the destination tower. Other miscellaneous options include changing the background theme and the rendered material for the disks and towers. There is also a levels feature when signing into Google with the application, which allows you to choose different puzzle levels and complete them.
